<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
    <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.Web browsers
    receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
    them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
    semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
    document.

    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
    images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into
    the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
    links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
    using angle brackets.
